## Next Steps

After mastering these basics, you can explore more advanced features of Clak:

- Subcommands for complex applications
- Custom argument types and validation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Configuration file integration
- And more!

Remember that Clak is built on top of Python's `argparse`, so you can leverage all its features while enjoying a more elegant, class-based interface. 




## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**:
   - Always provide docstrings for your parser class
   - Use descriptive help messages for arguments
   - Document the purpose of your `cli_run` method

2. **Argument Names**:
   - Use meaningful names for arguments
   - Provide both long and short forms for optional arguments
   - Follow command-line conventions (e.g., lowercase for options)

3. **Defaults and Validation**:
   - Provide sensible defaults when possible
   - Use choices for restricted options
   - Handle missing or invalid input gracefully

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Keep argument definitions clean and organized
   - Group related arguments together
   - Use type hints and docstrings for better code clarity

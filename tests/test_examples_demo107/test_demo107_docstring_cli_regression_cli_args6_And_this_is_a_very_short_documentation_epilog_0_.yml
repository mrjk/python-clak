  \ ...\n\nHello World of CLI !\n\nI'm the demo10 app, used to learn how to use clak.\n\
  \nTOFIX: However var interpolation is limited to text only. In the next\nexample,\
  \ see how text is shifted, and there if anything we can do:\n-- 8< -- \n\n    Demo\
  \ application with options and two subcommands, and a common argument.\n\n    This\
  \ is a two levels demo of an application with two subcommands:\n\n    - A subcommand:\
  \ command1\n    - A subcommand: command2, inherited from command1\n\n    \n-- 8<\
  \ -- \n\npositional arguments:\n\nsubcommands:\n  command1                  Execute\
  \ command 1\n  command2                  Execute command 2\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help\
  \                  show this help message and exit\n  --debug                  \
  \   Enable debug mode (default: False)\n  --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG  Config file\
